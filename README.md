# dumbbell_exercise-human_activity_recognition

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. It consists of different metrics measured while doing exercises with a dumbbell. It also includes a manner in whih every exercise was performed ("classe" variable). The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 

This report describes the model building process including different steps such as feature selection and cross-validation.

5 classification algorithms have been reviewed, but only the best performing are demonstrated in this report - Random Forest and Boosting. For expected Accuracy Rates, Out of Sample Errors and Final Predictions, refer to "Models Review and Prediction" section in the bottom of this document.
